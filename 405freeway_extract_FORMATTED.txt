[2015-05-22 02:00:32] Update: [Here's proof for this story.](https://www.cheapassgamer.com/topic/128532-the-old-gamerushblockbuster-thread/page-32). My CAG username is "kunai." You can just follow from that page and also see other crazy epic scores I've made. (Like the insane "Get any 5 games for $5 each" Blockbuster promo).

------

Back in the day (2007/2008) I found a major flaw in the POS at Blockbuster

Their system would update overnight, but only certain parts, and these parts were on different days of the week. Their new item prices would update on Thursday, their used prices would update on Friday- BUT their trade-in values would update after closing on Sunday.

This meant if a game dropped in MSRP, it's new version would first lower on Thursday morning ($49.99 to $19.99) and be cheaper than the used version. The next day, on Friday morning, it's used version would be lowered ($47.99 to $17.99).

The trade-in value would still be the same- usually $30-$35, even though you could pull the game off the rack, buy it for $20, then trade in back without leaving the line.

I did this a few times and felt bad so I emailed corporate to let them know about the loophole. They told me they didn't take in information/suggestions from outside parties, essentially because they had that set up as part of their "business strategy."

I then proceeded to assist them in their endeavors by buying 25+ copies of Beowulf from Best Buy for $9.99 ($19.99-$10 coupon) and trading them in for ~$800 in store credit.

Then I repurchased all 25 copies with the store credit for ~$500.

Then I traded them in again.

Then I bought them again.

I did this a few times over the weekend and ended up with $1200 in store credit from $250 cash. 

Then I found a few games GameStop gave good money for and traded them in over there for store credit. I made some preorder and eventually canceled them and requested cash back for the deposit.

I eventually got a letter from Blockbuster banning me from trading, but it had the wrong date (post dated for the next year) and I kept trading.

I don't feel bad about it.

[2015-05-22 11:23:25] I did this for Pick Up Stix when they first did online ordering. You could get a discount if you added two combos to your order. You could then remove one of them, add it back, and it gave you an additional discount. You could stack them enough times to get free food. I only stacked two discounts because I didn't want them to fix it.

[2015-06-06 09:02:33] Going to E3 is not a once in a lifetime opportunity. It's actually pretty easy to get in. Lines are long and like another user said, it's pretty much gone digital. It's very expensive to have floor space. 


**Where to stay for cheap**

Try AirBnB and Couchsurfing.org. 

Consider these areas for close/safe options: Echo Park, University Park, Pico-Union, Harvard Heights, downtown, Elysian Park, Chinatown. Ktown (Koreatown) is a little sketchy but also nearby. Don't stay in the Arts District. It will be expensive and has a very fine line between safe and sketch.

Pico-Union is where I live, and it's right next to the convention center. I highly recommend an airBnB near there.

The area immediately north of USC is University Park. School's out for summer. There are a lot of vacancies there. Stick to the area that's north of Jefferson between Hoover and Fig (Figueroa). 

Don't stay **anywhere** south of Exposition. This is for safety and distance reasons.


**Getting around for cheap**

Use Lyft/Uber. Easily the easiest and fastest way to get across town, as well as cheapest except for public transit. Don't rent a car. Don't use a taxi- they're scams here. 

When you first arrive, take a Flyaway bus from the airport to Union Station or Hollywood, depending on where you stay. When you depart, take a Lyft/Uber back to the airport.

Public Transit: Buses can be awful. Never rely on more than one. Light rail is fantastic, just don't take the Blue line. The Red/Purple/Expo lines will all get you within about half a mile of the convention center. The Expo line itself is literally a block away (Pico/Chick Hearn Station). These will require a TAP card (you load up with fares or day/week passes).


**After the show**

Downtown is amazing right now. Safe, fun, great food and bars. Our entire downtown is safe as long as you stay west of Main. East of Main is Skidrow, and you don't want to wander into it.

**Source/etc**

I've been to E3. I live next to downtown. I'm in downtown daily. I used to drive for Lyft/Uber. I've used airBnB/couchsurfing.

You can also PM me for a possible ride from the airport. Picking up there **sucks** but trust me, it will be a much better experience than a taxi/bus. Depends on what time your flight gets in. 

If you find a potential place to stay, you can also PM me the link/address and I can tell you whether it's an ideal location or not.

[2015-06-14 08:14:54] I really feel like I'm alone in this. It was such an awful movie and everything I see in every other Reddit thread is how much people loved it. It felt like a high budget fanfic:

I don't remember any of the characters' names.

No character had a growth arc. Nobody had a hero's journey. I

Attendance is "low" but the park is still packed to capacity.

They want to create a dinosaur to increase attendance, because people want to see something new. So they use cuttlefish DNA to give it camouflage which makes it near impossible to see, which counters the concept.

The cages have a single door that separates the dinosaurs from people. One door. No backup perimeter.

The new dinosaur rips out its tracking device. "How would it know to do that?" BECAUSE IT'S LOUD AS FUCK. "She remembered where they put it."

Everything is going to hell. Good thing we don't have override systems on our futuristic hamster balls that take guests back to the ride entrance.

Nostalgia pay off. Good thing this teenager can switch out a battery and get a Jeep running with 20 year old fossil fuel. Seriously though, what were their names?

Better use Raptors as blood hounds. No way this could backfire. Good thing Chris Pratt is the alpha. But now he's not. But he will be later. Again.

Better not close the doors in the back of the vet van. That wouldn't cross anyone's mind, ever.

This film brought to you by Starbucks, Verizon Wireless, Pandora Jewelers, and the bad guy that doesn't seem to have an actual plan. What was his name? 

Chris Pratt is alpha again for some reason.

Whatever, better go get the Trex to fight for us because that's what the audience wants.

Sharkosaurus ex machina. Right next to the tourist plaza, because why bother with perimeters, not like that was ever a problem in the past 23 years.

Everyone that matters is saved. The insurance company goes bankrupt. Chris Pratt gets contacted to lead a team of researchers that are studying the effects of evolution in dinosaurs four years later.

[2015-06-27 05:58:00] Titus, episode 51 "The Visit"

Titus's schizophrenic mom escapes from her mental hospital on the same day Titus and Erin try to adopt Amy, their niece, with a social worker visit. His mom appears at Titus's house with blood on her hands, and the whole episode is Titus trying to prevent his father and the social worker from finding his mother for fear of his father killing her in self defense (since she's an escaped schizophrenic who has killed people in the past). His mom continuously begs him to forgive her for being a horrible mother while he actively hides her in different parts of the house so nobody will see her. It's one of the funniest episodes of a sitcom I've ever seen with Stacey Keach being an absolute powerhouse of reaction comedy. Then at the end Titus gets his mom cornered in a closet ready to save her and take her back to the hospital, but then he gets a call from the mental hospital and is told his mother killed herself that morning. They open the closet to find she's disappeared, and Titus then realizes he's been seeing her ghost the whole time.

What makes this episode even more powerful for me is that I saw the live taping in 2001 or 2002, and they actually used trick doors to move the actress from one room to another- THEY LITERALLY MADE HER DISAPPEAR ON SET. They kept using misdirection so you would assume she snuck out of a room while you weren't looking. By the end of the taping when you see her go into the closet, which is the entire focal point of the scene, the door shuts and is opened two minutes later and the actress had disappeared. Gone. You watched her go in, and then there was nothing there. The entire audience had their jaws on the floor. Nobody expected it. The rest of the taping was eerily quiet because we were all trying to process the mindfuck of emotion we just endured.

Absolutely fantastic piece of television.

[2015-07-09 03:58:39] Don't stay near LAX. It isn't really near anything worthwhile. Santa Monica and downtown are probably the best places to stay in to be "near things."

NHL (hockey, Ducks and Kings) and NBA (basketball, Clippers and Lakers) will be in season. Ducks play at the Honda Center in Anaheim very close to Disneyland.

No baseball in February.

Disneyland you should go to on a weekday, don't go on a weekend or holiday. Make sure to get a corn dog from Main Street. I recommend at least two days if you can. 

A car rental makes sense because you'll be going up to San Francisco, but if you can hold off, just use Lyft/Uber while you're in Los Angeles. Our subway and light rail is very cheap but doesn't get your everywhere, but combined you can get around very frugally.

The drive up the coast to San Francisco is probably the best idea. Make sure you take PCH. Don't take the 5, for the love of God. SF is one of the greatest cities in the world, but parking and traffic will suck. Use Lyft/Uber instead of renting a car while you're up there.

Australian accents are also incredibly sexy to Americans. If you're average looking you automatically go up 2 points on a sexyness scale.

We call it "drunk", " hammered", "wasted", and " shitfaced." We don't call it pissed. If you get super drunk it's "white girl wasted." 

We don't call them pubs for the most part, they're "bars." Bars never have accommodations, but some hotels do have expensive bars in them.

[2015-07-26 04:39:23] To be fair, most questions are incredibly vague or have been asked hundreds of times a year ("We're coming into LA next year from out of town- what should we do?" and "I'm moving to LA from [different city]- am I going to make it?") and we get fed up with people not even trying to narrow down the question to their specific information.

If someone wants to ask something about how transit works with very specific details (LAX to downtown, Valley to Beverly Hills, Metro vs DOT, etc.) I typically give a very detailed answer because those questions can be very precise and finding the correct and most efficient answer through Google isn't possible. If they're going to ask "Where is a good place to park in Hollywood?" I'm going to tell them Jumbo's Clown Room.

[2015-08-02 05:39:13] Welcome to Los Angeles! I've been here for 25 years- this city is all I remember- but it wasn't until I was literally homeless that I figured out just how this city works, and how to use what it offers to benefit my broke ass. Whether you're frugal and looking to save money, have nowhere to go and need shelter, or are moving here from overseas with the intent of being a troubador, there's plenty of information to help you get by regardless of your budget.

Living out of your car: this was my situation. Living out of your car comes with a lot of benefits, but a lot of responsibilities and risks as well. You still need to pay registration and insurance (and possibly even payments if you still owe), have to park it somewhere when you aren't using it, and risk losing everything if you're involved in an accident. But your car also provides shelter and transportation, an essential in this vast city.

Costs to consider: the car itself, gas (as necessary), registration, insurance, maintenance

Benefits: shelter, transportation, storage.

Parking Laws: another liability is parking. Los Angeles has many different parking laws, most of which are posted. Always read the signs! 

Remember: you are NEVER allowed to park or stop in a red zone (parking is when you pull over and leave your car, stopping is when you pull over but don't actually get out of your car). You can NEVER park in a white passenger loading zone. You CAN park as long as you want in a yellow loading zone or a green zone between 6pm and 7am Monday through Saturday, and any time Sunday. You can NOT park for more than 72 hours without moving your car. You can NOT park between 10pm and 5am at most city parks. You cannot park between 2am and 6am in Beverly Hills and Pasadena. You can NOT park during rush hour in "Anti-Gridlock zones". Your car will be towed away- GUARANTEED. The times for these zones vary, but the most common hours are 7-9am and 4-7pm. READ THE SIGNS. Street Cleaning: read the signs!

Permit parking restrictions: these allow only residents of certain areas to park in that block.

Temporary parking restrictions: usually put up for major street projects or filming. These signs must be up for ONLY 24 hours for enforcement, meaning you could easily get towed away if you're away from your car for more than a day.

To help understand the parking rules, these signs are color coded: red means a restriction- green means a permission. 

Parking meters: enforced during limited parking hours only (typically 8am- 8pm, but READ THE SIGNS).

Disabled Placard Exemption: if you have a valid disabled placard, you do not have to adhere to hour maximum restrictions, nor do you have to pay for meter parking. This does NOT exempt you from restricted parking hours (such as "NO PARKING between 10pm-6am or 4pm - 7pm").

You can NOT park in any alley at any time. NEVER block a fire hydrant or driveway.

The other problem is we live in a city with so much to do, and going to a Dodger game is a four hour commitment minimum. That's a lot of time, especially for a last-minute event. If I go to a concert, I've got weeks of time to make sure I don't have anything conflict with it.

You can get this at Mitsuwa, Marukai, or other Asian grocery stores, though quality can vary greatly. Just look for the packages with the wasabi and soy sauce packets (and that little fake grass) in them.

I have been using Woori Market (formerly Mitsuwa) in Little Tokyo and have found it to be consistently fresh. I stopped by the Gardena Marukai flagship store recently and the salmon has a really strong fish taste- not ideal at all, but not going to make you sick.

If you want to try making your own, but not from scratch exactly, I **highly** recommend Fish King in Glendale. They sell premade Poké that is fantastic, and you can get a tub to go then add your own ingredients at home.

[2015-10-28 15:37:40] Hey, that's me!

I'm very active on /r/LosAngeles and an getting by well enough. I live in an area of the city that is for some reason less than desirable at the moment (Pico-Union, we're the next Silverlake) and thankfully only pay $875 for my one bedroom (with fiance to split that with).

That said, I've been in Los Angeles my whole life and it's insane how much people don't realize the reality of the actual working class, beyond the entertainment industry. People get up, go to work and drive or bus dozens of miles because they can't work closer- which causes traffic! So you lose time.

You spend your time in traffic to work your $15/hour because it's a solid paycheck, then get to drive back in traffic and see on Facebook all your friends going to Dodger/Clipper/Laker games, or concerts at Staples Center/The Greek/ The Hollywood Bowl/The Forum/Disney Concert Hall/The Troubadour, or dinner at a nice restaurant in Silverlake/Echo Park/Venice/Beverly Hills/Koreatown, or clubbing in West Hollywood/Hollywood/Downtown. 

A lot if this just means you feel like you aren't doing *as much* as everyone else, when you actually get the opportunity to do so much more than anyone else outside of LA (but your don't *have to* do it all) because you live in a city that can offer something EVERY NIGHT, and when you don't make six figures, you feel like you really aren't making much at all because you can't go out every. Single. Night.

It's all a "Keeping Up With My Friends" mentality. Yes I'm stressed out, but there's so much I've done this year that most people else in the world could never do in their whole lives.

I don't plan to ever own a home in Los Angeles, and I'm fine with that, because I played it smart and I'm rent controlled at 4%/year. I can live a great life, save up for a house somewhere between Seattle and Portland, and move when I'm ready to settle.

Until then, FUCK YEAH EXPO LINE, BITCH!

[2015-11-01 06:22:58] Carson is not "South LA" in it's typical meaning, it's actually part of the "South Bay" area.

The area directly south of downtown is historic South Central, and the further south, the worse the neighborhood. 

For the sake of simplification, you don't want to live south of Exposition west of the 110, and you don't want to live south of Adams on the east side of the 110. There are exceptions, but this is a pretty good line. Gang activity gets really bad as you make your way past 50th.

Most USC students won't even go south of the Coliseum because there are people on bikes who will try to steal their phones.

Downtown is expensive as hell now. $1500-$2000 for decent 1-bedrooms. Need a parking spot? Add $200-$300 depending on the area. The rent around Silverlake is comparable, but parking is easier. Your drive would be awful because you'd have to cut through downtown.

I suggest Pico-Union, but I always suggest Pico-Union. Easy access to Silverlake up Alvarado (15-20 minutes), a quick drive down the 110 to Carson (20-30 minutes), next to downtown and Ktown, cheap rent (I'm at $875/month 1-bedroom), near public transit (look up the Expo line- it's going to change LA), and perfectly safe. We have families walking around late into the night.

[2015-11-22 06:58:07] KROQ is now "Alternative first," which means they've dropped the "LA and OC's only new rock" slogan. It's just a pop-rock station now, playing Elle King, Foo Fighters, Chili Peppers and Nirvana on loop. I actually heard a new song (Throne- Bring Me To The Horizon) that I *loved* and re-requested, but CBS is currently pushing Fallout Boy and Vance Joy relentlessly.

Alt is still a travesty. It never recovered from their 2007 restructuring when they didn't even have a DJ for a month. The Woody Show is a faux-douche shock-jock wannabe failing to disguise its ad placements as actual content, and it conflicts with the rest of the station's style (their "radio edits" censor more than KROQ's).

We lost Indie 103 OTA. RIP. You can still stream online I think.

KLOS is starting to play more modern classics like American Idiot (a gap that KROQ isn't really filling anymore) but you won't get anything that's truly new.

You can also try 100.1, 100.3, 103.1, 88.7, and 90.1 but I'm not sure what they offer currently.

[2015-12-02 03:00:31] The games are just way too basic. They're too retro, and some of them aren't even good. The only real quarter eater they have is X-Men. They need Simpsons, Sunset Riders or TMNT to go with it.

They need Neo Geo: Metal Slug, Samurai Showdown, or Puzzle Bobble/Bust A Move.

They need Mortal Kombat II, 3, or UMK3 , or some other real fighting game besides Street Fighter 2. Marvel vs Capcom 1 or 2, Tekken Tag and 3-5, Soul Calibur 2, 3rd Strike- these games can be played at any skill level with fun, but also competitively.

I'd like to see a music game, but DDR/ITG/Pump are out of the question. They take up too much space, create too much noise, aren't a good idea for drunk people, and a complete novice can't pick it up and have fun. I'm sure there's a game that would work well, I'm just blanking right now.

If they want to keep it strictly retro, fine, but they're limiting themselves and won't be taken as a serious arcade scene, at which point they're a gimmick like Bar 82.

Their setup is also strange. A bar (diner?), but you also order from a waitress at the table, even though there's a counter as you walk in. I don't want to wait for a waitress- I want a beer and tokens when I walk in so I can start playing.

The food is expensive, especially for the area.

The only great thing was I could buy tokens with a credit card.

Also, their gift shop is actually fantastic, like a popup I Am 8-Bit store, but it's unfortunately named the "PWN SHOP." That's pretty cringe.

[2015-12-16 09:07:36] The email:

&gt;TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

&gt;I am emailing you to inform you of the happenings on Tuesday, 12/15/15.

&gt;Something big is going down. Something very big. It will make national headlines. Perhaps, even international ones. You see, my last 4 years here at one of the district high schools has been absolute hell. Pure, unmitigated, agony. The bullying, the loneliness, the rejection... it is never-ending. And for what? Just because I'm 'different'?

&gt;No. No more. I am a devout Muslim, and was once against violence, but I have teamed up with a local jihadist cell as it is the only way I'll be able to accomplish my massacre the correct way. I would not be able to do it alone. Me, and my 32 comrades, will die tomorrow in the name of Allah. Every school in the L.A. Unified district is being targeted. We have bombs hidden in lockers already at several schools. They are strategically placed and are meant to crumble the foundations of the very buildings that monger so much hate and discrimination. They are pressure cooker bombs, hidden in backpacks around the schools. They are loaded with 20 lbs. of gunpowder, for maximum damage. They will be detonated via Cell Phone. Not only are there bombs, but there are nerve gas agents set to go off at a specific time: during lunch hour. To top it off, my brothers in Allah and I have Kalashnikov rifles, Glock 18 Machine pistols, and multiple handheld grenades. The students at every school in the L.A. Unified district will be massacred, mercilessly. And there is nothing you can do to stop it.

&gt;If you do end up trying to, by perhaps, beefing up security, or canceling classes for the day, it won't matter. Your security will not be able to stop us. We are an army of Allah. If you cancel classes, the bombings will take place regardless, and we will bring our guns to the streets and offices of Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Bakersfield, and San Diego.


&gt;I wish you the best luck. It is time to pray to allah, as this may be your last day.

[2015-12-18 14:45:35] Update, if anyone is still following:

Last night I threw all their garbage back into their parking lot, which I've done for months, and continued to do even after going in and speaking with them several weeks ago. I also used their own cardboard as a sign and wrote "Stop Trashing Our Neighborhood" on it, then packing-taped it to their front door.

When I got home they had removed the cardboard from the front door, but [I still found this on the sidewalk](http://imgur.com/EzjQXNh).

Furious, I grabbed up their trash again and this time went to the front door and threw it into their lobby. I was extremely upset that they still had enough disrespect after my day of trying to contact them through Facebook, Yelp, Twitter and email.

I began yelling, no intention of being threatening, but trying to get them to understand how unacceptable it is to have such a disregard for public safety, sanitation, and decency.

I was loud. I swore, but mostly referring to the debris as "crap" and "shit" and I'm pretty sure I said fuck at some point, but I was very upset. There were four employees that I ended up speaking to, and probably scaring unintentionally.

Kacey managed to be very levelheaded and after my initial vent I was able to calmly voice my concerns and expectations from this point forward. 

I'll probably leave them a Christmas basket as an apology, as long as they don't dump anything else in the next week.

[2015-12-20 07:22:07] The problem is that they don't contract or schedule any sort of pick up. They leave it on the sidewalk and hope for someone to pick it up and ignore their responsibility to make sure it's properly disposed of or recycled.

They can easily leave it on their side of the gate in a nice stack that's visible from the street. They can have a sign, or speak with the people who do pick up the boxes and tell them they can pick them up from the parking lot where they have plenty of open space to store them, but they don't.

They leave the boxes on the sidewalk, along with plastic wrap, hard plastic tie-downs, and paperwork/flyers/inserts/Styrofoam/screws because they're too lazy to separate them. This blocks the sidewalk and often ends up in the gutter and in the street. I've seen elderly residents with their push-carts walk into the gutter just to avoid the boxes. I saw a kid on a skateboard nearly eat it after his board got stuck on the cardboard. A few weeks ago we had a driver sideswipe four cars on Pico in front of Equitas (the elementary school next door), and I don't want to come home one day to find a kid or any person was hit by a car because they stepped into the street to get around a pile of trash.

It's not acceptable to ignore your responsibility to properly dispose of something because sometimes someone else takes care of it.

[2015-12-22 09:32:02] I grew up in Los Angeles and majored in Cinema and Television Arts at CSUN, with parents both in broadcasting.

I've never had a paying job in film or TV. You end up working in the service industry because you need a paycheck, and then you very stuck doing that because you have no time for anything else.

There are so many people like you that the market is saturated. Interns are free, and there are new interns every 6 months. Why pay for the cow when another cow from USC or NYFA will milk itself for free?

Your rent will be at least $700/month with a roommate. By yourself will be $900 minimum if you manage to find it. More likely $1100. Plus utilities.

And if your rent is that low you'll need to commute pretty far to get to a lot. Burbank? Hollywood? Culver City? Fairfax? Arts District? If you get an apartment in Hollywood it's going to suck getting to Culver City everyday. If you get a spot in Westlake (because I doubt you'll be able to afford more than that) then Burbank becomes impractical.

Do you have a car? Insurance will be high for someone your age. Do you realize how big the city *actually* is? Do you know how to use Metro? Are you as excited for Expo Line Phase 2 as the rest of us? 

Do you know the difference between the city and the county? Who is our mayor? This is stuff you should probably know so people will take you seriously.

And no, there's no chance any employer will take your resume seriously if you don't live here.

[2015-12-23 02:38:56] Pico-Union is fantastic.

Our neighborhood is safe enough that families walk around at night. They make pupusas on the corner for $2. I'm rent controlled at $875 1-bedroom in a gorgeous building. In 20 years my rent will be $2,000 max. Parking is okay, much better than Ktown, Westlake or downtown.

It takes me 2 minutes to get to the 110 or 10 freeways in either direction, 2 minutes to drive to into downtown, or I can walk 10 minutes to get to the Blue/Expo lines. It takes about 15 minutes to walk to the Red/Purple in Westlake but a $4 Lyft would make that 3 minutes.

Unfortunately a lot of people litter and tag buildings frequently, but but we also have some great street artists, and the Graff Lab is right at Venice and Union.

All the people on the street are friendly, too.

[2016-01-14 16:28:26] I'm not sure why the price is so low.

There's no dedicated parking, but that's the **only** inconvenience we have. There's plenty of street parking, which is free after 6pm, and there's a park which is free to park at until 10pm.

We looked all over Padmapper and RadPad, but didn't want to pay for Westside Rentals. Every other 1-bedroom in Pico-Union was $1000-1300. We did find a studio for $775, but the building was very... aged.

Then I discovered Trulia Rentals which had this building listed.

Holy fucking shit. This building is gorgeous. Clean, freshly painted, nice tiling- it looked like they had renovated every single unit. Plus, they pay for water- we play 99¢ for trash and the electric bill is less than $1/day.

It took forever for our application to get approved, and we ended up getting a different unit than the one we originally applied for (though the one we got is actually better), and the office for the rental management company had terrible customer service, BUT we don't actually deal with them directly since our onsite manager handles everything- and there really aren't any problems.

All the neighbors are friendly (I actually know the names of people in the building) and the one noise complaint I made was fixed instantly.

The neighborhood is blue collar- lots of people out early for work, and families walk the street late at night.

I just think the rental company severely undervalued the location because I was ready to pay $1100- but because of rent control I won't have to pay that much until July 2021.

The stop sign is in a parking lot.

You could even make a legal U-Turn, never see the stop sign because it's further back and still receive these tickets.

The money goes to the pockets of MCRA who gave themselves the authority to issue tickets. 

I never paid my ticket, and nothing ever got put on any record- because they aren't legitimate infractions.

[2016-02-08 17:16:23] Copied and pasted from the last time:

Back in the day (2007/2008) I found a major flaw in the POS at Blockbuster

Their system would update overnight, but only certain parts, and these parts were on different days of the week. Their new item prices would update on Thursday, their used prices would update on Friday- BUT their trade-in values would update after closing on Sunday.

This meant if a game dropped in MSRP, it's new version would first lower on Thursday morning ($49.99 to $19.99) and be cheaper than the used version. The next day, on Friday morning, it's used version would be lowered ($47.99 to $17.99).

The trade-in value would still be the same- usually $30-$35, even though you could pull the game off the rack, buy it for $20, then trade in back without leaving the line.

I did this a few times and felt bad so I emailed corporate to let them know about the loophole. They told me they didn't take in information/suggestions from outside parties, essentially because they had that set up as part of their "business strategy."

I then proceeded to assist them in their endeavors by buying 25+ copies of Beowulf from Best Buy for $9.99 ($19.99-$10 coupon) and trading them in for ~$800 in store credit.

Then I repurchased all 25 copies with the store credit for ~$500.

Then I traded them in again.

Then I bought them again.

I did this a few times over the weekend and ended up with $1200 in store credit from $250 cash.

Then I found a few games GameStop gave good money for and traded them in over there for store credit. I made some preorder and eventually canceled them and requested cash back for the deposit.

I eventually got a letter from Blockbuster banning me from trading, but it had the wrong date (post dated for the next year) and I kept trading.

I don't feel bad about it.

[2016-02-25 15:41:01] I have, but the time it takes just doesn't work out for my schedule. 

I've done the Silver Line which is fantastic for the first part, but then another $12 Lyft or Uber to get exactly where I need to. A bike is my other option for that last leg but that still takes another half hour per day each way.

It makes more sense financially to have my truck on me for the chance someone needs help moving something.

[2016-02-29 09:20:37] I went and it was fantastic!

Water levels vary throughout the river, and I'm sure there's a waist high point somewhere in there, but the paths we took were mostly a foot high to knee deep. It's 5 miles there and 5 miles back.

Bungee jumping at the bridge is a private company. You can get a Groupon for therm.

There are a few areas that had been hit by rock slides and left very narrow paths- those were definitely more of a danger.

Only animals I saw were birds and lizards.

Bugs weren't an issue- a few flies, bees, ants, butterflies and I even came across a millipede.

I can recommend it for kids 12 and up.

A **lot** of people brought their dogs of all sizes.

There are no bathrooms after the first half mile from the parking lot. Buy an Adventure Pass for parking from REI before going. Parking fills up fast.

No water fountains- bring bottles, canteens, or a filter if you plan on drinking river water.

You can camp up there Friday and Saturday and holiday nights, but I don't know if you need a permit.

[2016-03-16 11:54:51] &gt;What area of town is good for people our age and is relatively affordable?

All parts of town are great in one way or another. Relatively affordable here can range from $900-$2000 for a 1-bedroom depending on your job.

&gt;What is the job market looking like out there?

Surplus of workers. All the job sites are full of scams. Our minimum wage goes up to $15 in the next few years and that's going to drive up the cost of rent so unless you lock in now with RSO it won't really benefit you.

&gt;How's the traffic, obviously it is bad, but how bad is bad?

It can take an hour to go five miles if everything goes wrong. Nobody knows how to drive in the rain which leads to accidents. Glendale is statistically the worst place to drive in the country but a lot of that is insurance fraud. Encino and Koreatown also have awful drivers.

[2016-04-11 02:57:08] We won't insult you, we'll just assume you're either from out of state or a douchebag and won't take you seriously. We don't want to, it's just the local experiences we've had with people who say "Cali" in Los Angeles.

People who say "Cali" tend to be stereotyped as not really being from *Los Angeles*. It's perfectly acceptable to say "Cali" in Orange County, IE, or Palmdale/Lancaster- basically anywhere "Hella" is still used, but for some reason the *only* people I know who say Cali (that are from Los Angeles) are douchebags. 

This might change over the next generation, but "Cali" is a recent term in modern language. I never heard anyone say it in high school. It's prominence as an abbreviation (compared to CA) is bizarre- like with Los Angeles going to LA then to LosAn. It's *weird*. It feels wrong. If I heard someone say "I'm from LosAn" I wouldn't know what the hell is wrong with them. So when you say "Cali" I have to question somethings about you. *I'm* from California. I grew up here. I wrote the word and said "California" my whole life. I don't even say "LA" very often because you always say "Los Angeles" growing up as a kid. Yes, the media says "LA" all the time, which is why I accept it- I grew up with that.

So now when someone says "I'm from Cali" or "I'm visiting Cali" I automatically know you didn't grow up with that word and are forcing it for some reason, either social or cultural. Young kids that have social media and are using it are different- they are actually growing up with the word "Cali." If you're an adult, you've probably heard the word "California" your whole life, like me, but never heard "Cali" until after MySpace/Facebook were created.

There's also a difference in HipHop and skate culture where Cali send to be perfectly acceptable already, but these are micro-cultures and don't really account for *most* of Los Angeles.

But again- this is *my* experience as someone from Los Angeles. I don't know what Orange County people had growing up (because everyone over there seems to use it), but it's a *completely* different culture over there. I don't know why it's gotten so big in the HipHop world either.

But this is Reddit, and we make jokes about things.

So when you come into a Los Angeles subreddit, asking us for help or advice on something, we are going to tell you that you will stand out as a tourist if you say "Cali." 

The "don't call it that" is a reference to an Arrested Development joke regarding Orange County being abbreviated to "The OC." There are people who think that "The OC" is a terrible abbreviation for Orange County, and we just borrow the line for the same reason- we think "Cali" is a terrible abbreviation for California.

That's at least been my experience.

So just don't say "Cali" if you want to be taken seriously by most people in Los Angeles.

You'll be looking at a one hour morning drive, easily. 

Your return commute may be a different route (some 605/710/5/105/91 combination) and will probably be 1:15.

This all depends on the time you leave and how far south into HB you are.

[2016-04-26 08:16:26] #DO NOT PAY THIS

The stop signs are placed to intentionally get you to roll through them. Stop Sign cameras are NOT enforceable in California. Red light cameras are different. The money from these tickets goes to the people in the MRCA to line their pockets. MRCA is not exempt- they literally are just making this up and implementing it for money.

They send a very threatening letter to you that has you mail money to North Hollywood. 

The video is sent to someone in Arizona who "testifies" they witnessed you breaking the law in the video.

You will get "collections" calls, but because it's not a debt or a fine that's legal in the State of California they can't actually do anything.

Source: I got a ticket and never paid it. The DMV doesn't know or care, and my LAPD background investigation didn't care because it's not a real citation. They wouldn't have known if I didn't tell them.

Not a flip opportunity for most people- not in that neighborhood. You could probably rent it to USC students that can't afford University Park for cheap.

If the pipes/foundation are good, there's no mold or smoke damage, and no infestations I think this house could be very nice in 30 years when you're done paying it off.

&gt;Hey all, so my gf, dog, and I are planning to move to LA in August (driving out from Miami late July). Moving for work reasons and tired-of-Miami reasons - I do freelance video work and have one company I'll be shooting for once I move and I've got some other options as well.

You aren't set with work- be prepared to struggle. I do freelance video work, too, but even my viral project video resulted in nothing but a small check from YouTube.

&gt;The issue right now is finding a cheap place to live. I'd love to keep the rent under $1000, and I haven't had too much of a problem finding studios for less than that, but most of them are looking to find tenants for July. Should I just wait it out a bit longer or what?

Under $1000 with a dog is basically impossible in any decent area. If you wait it out you'll be competing with even more transplants coming in for the new school year.

&gt;Also, I'm currently looking on Westside Rentals and PadMapper. 

RadPad and Trulia Rentals.

2012 was one hell of a summer.

Tldr she's probably just busy with shit.

First girl I had known for years through work but didn't realize she was insane (like, legit "mother in an institution" crazy), second one was a classmate from high school who I had just started hanging out with (and didn't know she was on meth in high school) and the third one I met arbitrarily in Anaheim after a concert.

[2016-08-13 07:16:51] I was hired to work on it for a four-hour block with a new client (never met before) yesterday and had assumed there were blueprints or a kit I would be working from.

There was a new lead carpenter who was taking on the project continuously, plus a few other people that were apparently coming through later on to also help. 

Client was insistent that everything be done by Sunday (two days later) when the kids got home. I already stressed that the entire support is basically *nothing* but I don't think they were wiling to abandon the project. I told the new lead carpenter all of this and stressed it isn't safe, but since I was hired for just that four hour block and didn't do anything to adjust/fix any part of it structurally (I was staining unsanded wood on the trim which is a completely different issue I had brought up before I even got there) I left it up to him to figure out.

I already contacted the referral company that sent me and told them I want nothing to do with this project. It's an abomination.

[2016-08-14 05:26:09] I get that they're temporary, but there was no lumber to even begin making any sort of post/support, and client didn't want me to spend two hours going to Home Depot after the first run they had already done that morning (they bought fence pickets to use as planks...).

That's the problem- I was literally hired to continue work (for four hours) without any advance knowledge of the project. They said I would be staining most of the time, so I just assumed they had everything else in order. I got there and they had random pieces of hardware scattered across the backyard (and were running back and forth to Home Depot), an insane amount of excess cut lumber, and no blueprints, drawings, or even sketches to refer to- just images of the "look" they were going for. And everything **"had"** to be done in two days.

If I had been hired to design it, I would have had a list of all lumber, fasteners, stain, sealant (which they didn't want to use), tools, etc. ready to go before beginning construction.

But I wasn't.

I walked into a nightmare and told the only other two people there, "Hey, this is wrong, this isn't safe, you need fix this, I'm not going to be be here long enough to do it myself."
https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/4xjw3n
==========

[2016-08-14 05:48:08] No. I asked the client and they didn't want **anything** sanded or sealed- just stained.

That was probably the first red flag but you don't argue with your client. I explained it wouldn't last (especially with the ocean a mile away) but they were adamant about not wanting it to look "shiny" despite me pushing for a matte finish.

I've never heard of this neighborhood and had to map it to figure out where it was. I think most people would consider the area Playa del Rey.

As for all you want in a neighborhood, Culver City is definitely the only place that meets pretty much everything. There's no reliable public transit into Del Rey so you'll be driving or Lyft/Uber, but you can hop the Expo line into downtown from Culver really easily.

[2016-08-17 04:02:31] /r/AskLosAngeles next time.

&gt;I've lived on the east coast all of my life. All I've seen of LA is from movies and TV.  I've just never had the chance to go out west. 

Most movies don't portray Los Angeles realistically. Personally I think Nightcrawler is the best one in years.

&gt;LA looks so massive that I just can't seem to comprehend it. I can't tell the different areas apart. Where are the different areas?

"Greater Los Angeles Area" covers all cities in Los Angeles County plus parts of Orange County.

Los Angeles County covers all the cities in the county, including Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, West Hollywood, Long Beach, Culver, Burbank, Glendale, Compton, Inglewood, and dozens upon dozens more. There are also unincorporated areas and designated census areas, like East Los Angeles.

We have frequent debates here about what Westside, Eastside, Central, West LA, and East LA actually include.

Los Angeles City is there biggest city in the county, which includes **neighborhoods** like Hollywood, downtown, Watts, Koreatown, Silverlake, Echo Park, West LA, Encino, Van Nuys, Miracle Mile, Fairfax, Mid-city, Crenshaw, Venice, etc.

I've got work right now but I'm sure someone else will finish the details.

==========

[2016-08-17 06:59:31] &gt;What goes on in those different areas?

Whatever the culture offers. Downtown has nightlife, beach cities have the beach, Hollywood has clubs, Silverlake has hipster stuff, Los Feliz has Griffith Park- and you can drive to any of these to experience them.

&gt;Where do the wild fires occur? 

Almost always north or west of the valley (170/134/210 freeways) but now and then we get them south of the 101/134.


&gt;What are the lower class, high class, and middle class areas? 

Lower class: Westlake, Skid Row, **all** of South Central (south of 10, west of Crenshaw, and east of the river), Palmdale/Lancaster, parts of Koreatown and Hollywood, parts of Echo Park. The "parts" are quickly gentrifying but rent control is amazing to people who locked in with 2-bedrooms at $800/month so it's hard to get into those neighborhoods.

Upper class: Beverly Hills, Rancho Park, Century City, Bel Air, Encino, Pacific Palisades, Cheviot Hills, Holmby Hills, Playa del Rey... there are a lot.

Middle class: everywhere.

&gt;It always looked to me (in the media) like you see some areas that look amazing and great to live in. And other areas are really sketchy. Where is this dividing line between rich and poor that I see so frequently portrayed in movies/tv? 

The 10 freeway.

&gt;I recently started rewatching Weeds. I know the town in the show is fictional, but where do areas like Agrestic exist? 

That's a parody of West Hills/Calabasas/Agoura.

[2016-08-24 17:24:41] A couple years ago I randomly found a chameleon crossing the street in Burbank, CA, maybe a mile from Nickelodeon.

He was literally crossing the road, not giving a fuck. I pulled over and just watched him climb a tree as he got to it. He looked at me, looked back, and just kept climbing.

I flagged down a biker parked across the street and borrowed his gloves to grab the chameleon and named him Phil.

Phil bit me as I grabbed him. I kept him in a box for a few days as I tried finding an owner. Nobody on Craiglist had the right location, and nobody from the local pet store (Scales and Tails) ever claimed him.

I ended up giving him to a reptile breeder in East Hollywood because I didn't have the environment to keep him healthy.

But no matter what happened, Phil would immediately start climbing. From the carpet floor onto hair, fingers, didn't matter- he would grab and climb.

But we found out Phil was a girl. So we called her Lil.

I miss that Rugrat.

[2016-08-28 05:25:18] I think the real reason is that most people who live a vandwelling lifestyle don't have the money to purchase a Tesla. I'm sure many do, but even then it's a cost/return thing. That Tesla costs $650/month, but a regular car (or even a truck/SUV with enough space to sleep) would cost half that. There's plenty of argument either way.

Basically if you're living out of your vehicle to save money, you may well save as much as you can.

The gym showering is awesome, though. I lived out of my car in the past and $30/month for an LA Fitness membership was absolutely worth it.

[2016-09-11 17:01:29] This happened a few years ago.

I worked at a seasonal public pool and the day before opening we did the annual clean up to make sure it was ready to go. The staff had known each other for years so we would all mess with each other.

This was also the day LAPD would stop by to meet the manager and coordinate on general public safety.

So while we're all cleaning, I'm unaware that a female LAPD officer is talking with the manager. I've been working nonstop and haven't had a break, and I downed a gallon of water. I finish with my current task and then head for the employee bathroom (nicer than the locker room bathrooms) and notice the door is closed, so somebody must be there. Charles? Jessica? *Who*?

Having to pee really bad, I decided to just walk up to the door and say really loudly "Aagh! Who's in the bathroom!?"

**"Police."** A strong, solid female voice responded.

What the fu- OH SHIT THE PUBLIC SAFETY THING.

I bolted out to the guys locker room to pee then just kept cleaning, hoping she would never know it was me. I saw her outside later but then never again after that.

It was like a reverse raid.

[2016-09-13 06:03:45] I was at a church carnival years ago and Edward James Olmos was there. I was young and barely knew who he was, and he was volunteering at the arcade where I was playing DDR. 

I'm *relatively* good (enough to get a crowd of people who have never seen someone play before) so he was watching me, slightly impressed, and then walked away.

I actually talked with him after that game about me being a film major and he recommended Battlestar Galactica, since I had never seen it. He even gave me his personal email!

I kept playing DDR and this young latina girl, she looked about 15, walked up after I was done playing. 

Her: "You're really good!" 

Me: "Oh, thanks."

Her: "Yeah he thought you were really good, too."

She half-pointed over to Edward James Olmos.

Me: "Oh is that you're dad?"

Her: "No, he's my husband."

Me: "...Oh."

It was Lymari Nadal. 

I felt so embarrassed, because I legitimately thought she was a teenager and my reaction came out as "Oh, that's a big age difference" as opposed to "Oh, you just look so young" (she was around 30, I was 21).

I sent Mr. Olmos an email a few weeks later after I happened to walk by his office at the Disney lot, just a quick "Oh, didn't know you had an office here!" and he actually responded, but I never bothered him after that.

Tl;dr I thought Lymari Nadal was the daughter of Edward James Olmos because she looks half her age.

Edit: I just went through my emails and found I actually got his cellphone number then as well. No idea if it's still his, and no I'm not calling it.

[2016-09-14 05:48:55] I'm not an art teacher, but I worked at a pool that had a summer camp next door

One day the counselors gave us a bunch of coloring book drawings the kids had done of a camp (they photocopied the page so every kid had the same basic cabin/flagpole/etc).

We started taping them up in the lobby but one of them looked very violent. I looked at it closer and saw (spelled incorrectly) the words ("internment camp") and realized there were stick figures covered in blood, planes shooting down at the camp, and a Japanese flag at the flagpole.

It was like this kid had seen a WW2 documentary then jumbled everything onto this drawing.

No name was on it, just like most of the other drawings.

[2016-09-15 14:17:48] &gt;The weird thing is that my "body image," if that's the right term to use here, is still that scrawny kid. I think of myself as physically inferior

I have that same problem even with *being* in shape. I was was super ripped about 4 years ago after a massive breakup and suddenly realized I was actually desirable.

But... I never *saw* it. There's no point where I've been and able to look at myself in there mirror and say "I look good *to me*." People would tell me I looked good- I had muscles and abs, but I just couldn't believe them. I really didn't see it. 6'2", waist 32- why not 30? The other guys are able to do 40 crunches in a minute- why can't I get past 30? Even now, I'm still wrestling with "being fat" despite doing marathons and having just a small beer belly. I still have that "V" on my hips but it feels like a lie.

Plus, I'm starting to bald which is something I can't control- but being in shape is completely in my hands. If I'm not in shape to make up for my receding hairline, then how can people respect how I look?

So now I feel like I'm not doing enough, and that's just stress.

I still feel like I'm the chubby kid from middle school that just didn't fit in. 

It sucks.

Live as close to work as you can afford. Stay west of the 405 if possible. Avoid the valley if you can. Consider Culver City/Palms.

&gt;How safe is biking there? 

On the west side it's pretty safe.

&gt;I'll be moving there by my lonesome and know no one. Does anyone have any experiences about how they adjusted to the new place and how they made new friends? Where are the places to meet people? 

Meetups, bars.

&gt;Is Los Angeles liveable without a car? 

With Lyft and Uber and Taskrabbit, yes. The Expo line makes public transport from the westside into central LA and downtown very easy.

LA is massive. Culture is different in each neighborhood. Housing is expensive. Go Dodgers.

Denver is a major international hub, and all business is booming. Everywhere is hiring. There's energy, banking, aerospace... a lot of major business sectors. There's new international money flowing in going directly to the massive amounts of people who work here, where in Los Angeles it feels like it's only going to developers and the already wealthy. Unemployment is well below national average. People don't work too make ends meet- they seem to work towards a better community. It doesn't feel like people are stuck at jobs, because there's opportunity all around them if they work towards it.

They have light rail that's incredibly reliable and expansive and it's downtown centric. Imagine if Los Angeles had the Orange Line continue down to Agoura Hills, and the Red Line extended up along the 118 to Chatsworth, but you never had to transfer- they both went straight to Union Station, and there's a light rail at Union Station that takes you straight to the airport- but the airport is in Monrovia, so you don't ever go out of the way to actually get to it- it's always in the direction of travel. So if you live in Santa Monica you can take the Expo Line straight to the airport. Sepulveda Pass? It's flat and they have a light rail paralleling it. Basically they've done an amazing job in planning out their system and have space to expand easily- so much space. And they're building apartment housing *right next* to the stations to encourage people to not have cars here. Downtown is a traffic mess that's worse than ours, however, but with so much light rail into it I can't encourage anyone to actually drive into it.

Housing is being built nonstop- and it's affordable. $300k can get you a really nice, big house in the equivalent of the valley. $400-$500k closer to the city. Plus, they have acres upon acres ready for more.

Gas is $1.99 or less almost everywhere. Insurance is well under $100/month for most people with a car. People have so much money you can find really nice used cars/trucks cheap if you look.

There's an area east of downtown (east of where the Broncos play) that is rural ghetto. It's just like the Coliseum's south side- but it still has space for development.

The homeless people are apparently labeled "travelers" which skews the actual problem, which I disagree with. It's pretty comparable with Los Angeles. Tent cities, shanty towns. Some guy kept calling me Wolverine and to step away from his girl (my fiance) but it was the equivalent of Los Angeles St.

There's *a lot* of white people, which is something I've never really felt before in Los Angeles. Not that it's better or worse, just incredibly different. 

Outdoors is life. Hunting, fishing, camping, snow sports. Every house has a gun, but everyone is smart about it.

Police have no chill- you get pulled over for going 5mph over. Bikes have the right of way more than in Los Angeles (merging/blocking/turning into or from a bike lane is prohibited- no dashes allowing cars to use them).

Red Rocks amphitheater destroys the Hollywood Bowl as a venue. My god that place is humbling.

If there's a major national sit down chain restaurant, it's here. Park Meadows is the most gorgeous mall I've ever seen. High end fashion and style is better than the Beverly Hills and Century City boutiques.

You can take a bus from downtown into Golden to the Coors brewery and drink 3 free 10oz beers every day (except Tuesday/Wednesday) if you want. But here's the thing- you can get buzzed off of a single beer because of the elevation. And it's a different buzz than in Los Angeles. It actually feels different. Everyone makes fun of Coors Light for being like water, but at this elevation, it's crisp, refreshing, and actually gets you drunk quickly. And 100+ years ago, that's all that mattered. But there's still a major craft scene (three craft breweries less than a quarter mile from the Coors plant), and Denver gas the highest actual number of craft breweries apparently in the country- with room for more.

There's no pollution, relative to Los Angeles. The air is thinner so the sun is actually brighter, too. There's no ocean, but there are lakes. It's flat. All the nearest mountains are to the west. No earthquakes. Tornados do appear but that's further east. The sunsets are fucking beautiful but are early because of the Rocky Mountains. 

Prairie dogs everywhere. Churches everywhere. Broncos everywhere. Pepsi everywhere. Subarus everywhere.

Go Dodgers.

==========

[2016-12-23 05:10:30] It's possible a lot of these people are mentally disturbed and project their fears onto whatever concept has the most peer support. 

We had crazy people 20 years ago, but they were relatively alone or had local support groups to help them. If someone had a nonsensical view they were dismissed by the general population.

Now you can go online and find any niche community that supports your personal view despite all evidence to the contrary. And then this support reverberates inside a safe-space echo chamber that makes these delusional people believe that such outlandish problems exist and are so common and constant that it *becomes* reality. 

We've seen this with the gender roles. Some people believe that there is something beyond man, woman, transsexual or hermaphrodite. They associate their physical body with "dragon-kin" or other weird pronouns to distinguish themselves, but these are emotional. They refuse to believe it isn't true that they have "something else" inside them, but these things are in their mind. It doesn't mean they don't feel like X or Y, but physically we all come down to the two sexes- male and female. But tell them that and they refute it and say they're being persecuted. You can feel whatever you want in your sexuality but it doesn't change what you are physically. Fetishes, homosexuality, beastiality, pedophilia- you can have one or all of those but you are still a *human*.

So they feel like they're being mistreated, and rally for support from other people who feel victimized, alone, or vulnerable- just like a cult.

And the problem is real.

But then we live in our own niche communities and have our own echo chamber that affects how we perceive their mission, and on Reddit it's fairly dismissive- but it also leads to us ridiculing them and not acknowledging that we have mentally unstable people recruiting a new generation into believing these strange feelings that start with puberty are perfectly natural and they transcend to your physical body. It was the same way with inoculations- we had people preaching incorrect health information and it's resulted in thousands of preventable deaths. 

We've just started experiencing this new wave of sexual identity association beyond male and female and we have **no idea** what repercussions it's going to lead to.

[2016-12-26 12:51:05] It makes perfect sense if you live here. 

Here's an example of directions from Malibu to the Rose Bowl. Say them out loud:

"Take PCH to the 10 to the 110 to the 210."

Versus:

"Take 1 to 10 to 110 to 210."

Or worse:

"Take the Pacific Coast Highway to the Santa Monica Freeway to the Harbor Freeway to the Arroyo Seco Parkway to the Foothill Freeway."

You also have to drive on stretches of freeway for so long that their names change and make giving directions difficult if you use them. The Hollywood Freeway and Ventura Freeway are both the 101. But the 134 is also the Ventura Freeway. The Harbor Freeway is same thing as Arroyo Seco Parkway, just after the 5 freeway.

So if I gave you directions from Watts to Studio City, I could just say "Take the 110 to the 101 and exit Laurel Canyon" instead of "Take the Harbor Freeway to the Hollywood Freeway then merge onto the Ventura Freeway and exit Laurel Canyon." Which one is easier to say and understand? Even more complicated, the 101 and 134 are *both* "the Ventura Freeway."

People who have never been here don't seem to understand how vast our city and county are, and that the numbers are consistent while the names are not.

[2016-12-31 07:21:20] &gt;1. On my block, we recently got new parking signs and what looks like something that was taped over for where it would normally say "except saturday and sunday." How do I go about finding out if the tape is real or not real? 

If it's that white reflective industrial tape, it's real. They usually make these signs in bulk with generic message and then tape off the parts that don't apply. You see the same thing with arrows where they tape off one end of this thing: &lt;---&gt;

&gt;2. Is there anywhere I can find a conclusive answer about motorcycle parking and sharing a meter with other drivers - I pay the meter if it's running out - in cities like Beverly Hills or Santa Monica. I haven't had trouble in SM, but feel like Beverly Hills might.

&gt;But say I had a trip on there, he should have escorted me to the validator and made sure a tapped. End of the story. I would have been fine with that.

No, that would never happen, because then everyone would always have "just one trip" loaded and use that excuse when Sheriff's finally pinch them. If you could prove you just bought it you might find leniency, but even then it's clear cut that **"You must tap before every boarding."** EVERY boarding. The signs and PA say that EVERYWHERE to prevent this.

&gt;Being that I didn't have a trip on there and I showed him that I had a bunch of singles and could clearly pay the dollar and change to ride the rail, he should have then said, "Ok, I'll walk you to the tap machine to make sure you purchase a trip etc."

No, because again **everyone** would do this if it worked like that. The first time they rolled out TAP they were lenient, but it's been in use for years and they have all the warnings and info upfront.

[2017-01-03 09:27:41] That's for one wall, one color. A single room with the same color would take about 5 hours total. Tape off the trim, clean the wall, sand the wall, wipe down/vacuum, first coat, second coat, clean up. A single room that is the *exact* same color all around (including ceiling) is much easier than taping off a single wall and having to be meticulous. Textured ("popcorn") walls are a pain too.

I recently painted an entire kitchen, living room wall and bedroom wall for a Redditor. All three were different colors, high ceilings, 12 feet or so across. Different colors adds time in-between because you can't use the same brushes/rollers. She was quoted $700 from a local company (that she reached out to first). I did it for $450. That's $150/wall. I'll send you photos later tonight, I'm going back for touchups this afternoon.

But yes, if you're going hire someone to just "paint" a wall without caring about doing it right, don't pay me.

Then I have to get there in my truck, and my service area is Malibu to Porter Ranch to Pasadena and down to Long Beach. I can't adjust it for distance. I don't get paid for travel to or from clients. I don't get paid to go to Home Depot to pick up supplies either. I have to adjust for that. I don't nickel and dime for supplies either.

Most importantly, I get booked solid for moving jobs (8 hours a day of moving and driving) which I love doing the most. I make $45/hour gross on all of them and can easily charge more and *still* get booked. But I have other skills, and when people want to utilize my other skills I'm not going to sell myself short and charge less than what I'm worth doing anything else. 

Also, nobody is forcing anyone to book me. My hourly rate is upfront. Clients can easily see I cost more than many other people but they choose me anyway.

It's an amazing experience. Let me know if you want to go sometime, I'll pick you up in Westlake.

I mean, the act is deplorable, but fine him for the cleanup, give him insane probation, and teach him what the fuck he actually did. This guy is going to be broke as hell in four years with nothing to show for it, and taxpayers will pick up the burden. He's not going to be able to afford $38k, ever. This crime is stupid, not violent. We shouldn't be making it cost us more than it has.

[2017-01-28 04:03:29] I can do anything I want.

My work days involve driving through West Hollywood, Beverly Hills, and Santa Monica because it's faster than the freeways and it takes at least 45 minutes to get home but I know how to get around traffic.

I can skateboard through downtown, the Arts District, and Little Tokyo, and an Uber back home is $3. My coffee costs more. The other day I got all the way to the [Always Sunny](https://www.instagram.com/p/BPvbIGMA8EzdHW-eZjWBtuuT3KQBdDOiQ1tflI0/) building just because.

I can buy one macaroon for $2.50 from Bottega Louie or pupusas on the street for $1 each. I can wait in line at Shake Shack or eat like a proper gentleman at In-N-Out. Denny's is garbage, Norms is life. Have you even heard of Dino's? KBBQ, SGV Chinese food, sushi, elote, asada, Papa Christo's, danger dogs, Mendocino, Lucy's, Langer's, Lemonade, Lawry's, Urth, Stinking Rose, Caveman Kitchen, Happy Taco, King Taco, El Flaming Taco, paleteros, "Tamales! Tamales!"

Bars? *Everywhere.* Upscale, hipster, lounge, club, dive, trap, sports, sake, beer, whiskey, single, dance, group, arcade...

Groceries aren't taxed. Costco, Trader Joe's, Smart and Final, Numero Uno, Vallarta, Ralphs, Vons, Northgate- you probably live near one of those, which is super convenient. You can at least host people if you can't afford to go out.

I freeze to death at 50° but once it's February and hits 75° I run shirtless across Redondo, Hermosa and Manhattan Beach. I'll get fresh Poké for lunch then hit up the craft breweries in South Bay.

Nature? Griffith Park, Runyon Canyon, Angeles Forest, Kenneth Hahn, Lake Balboa, Silverlake, Elysian, Echo, top of Reseda, even fucking Barnsdall is serene.

Snow? Big Bear. Snow Valley. Mammoth.

Culture? Getty, Getty Villa, LACMA, Gene Autry, Petersen, MOCA, Broad, Jurassitech, Expo Park, the rest of Museum Row, Watts Towers, alleys full of street art across the whole city...

Colleges? UCLA, USC, CSUN (Matadors!), CSULA, CSUDH, LMU, MSM, Pierce, Valley, Santa Monica, LACC, Pasadena, Glendale...

Amusement? Disneyland, Knotts, Universal, Six Flags, Sherman Oaks Castle Park, The Grove, the Zoo, the observatory, Hollywood and Highland, LA Live...

Live stage? UCB, ZJU, The Improv, Flappers, VPAC, Magic Castle, Jimmy Kimmel, The  Price Is Right, nearly every sitcom on TV...

Style? Rodeo Drive, Slauson Swap Meet, The Farmers Market, Arts District, MacArthur Park, Melrose, Fairfax, Fashion District, Crenshaw, Abott Kinney, the Galleria, PDC...

Conventions? E3, AX, Stan Lee's Comic Con, car shows, fitness expos, career summits, Adult Con, Reptile Expo, Tattoo Expo, League of Legends world championships...

Sports? Dodgers are life. Fuck you if you say anything against them. Lakers, Kings, Clippers, Galaxy, that new football club. Trojans, Bruins. Rams are a thing, kind of, but not really. Chargers are a joke. The Angels aren't Los Angeles.

Want to blackout for just a weekend? Vegas is a 5 hour drive away. So iS TJ. Jumbo's is down the street though.

Need to get away? SF, Portland, and Seattle are $50 roundtrip from LAX if you play it right. 

Broke? $1.75 can get you nearly anywhere on Metro. Go run, or bike. Cic La Via is free. Someone will try to steal your bike if you leave it outside.

There's so much goddamn music it's impossible to do everything. Coachella, FYF, Hard, Roxy, Viper Room, Troubadour, Spaceland, Echo... I'm not even close to listing even 5% of venues. Go wander across York between Fig and Eagle Rock. One of the best live shows I've been to was Kitten at a house party.

It's also hard to make plans with friends because everyone is always doing *something* and nobody lives near you. I still have a copy of One Night Ultimate Werewolf sealed from over a year ago because nobody has been able to come over to play it.

If you don't know how to drive I will yell at you. I will literally yell at you if you stop between 4 and 7pm on Olympic because you deserve it. If you signal I will let you do anything, even if it's stupid, just because you've warned me. DON'T BLOCK THE INTERSECTION YOU UNCALCULATED FUCK.

"I got a parking ticket." Did you read the signs?

"Why are there helicopters at-" **BECAUSE THIS IS LOS ANGELES.**

"Hollywood is so fake." So stop going there.

"Where should I live?" As close to work as possible.

"I got a red light ticket. Do I have to pay it?" [Maybe, maybe not. Maybe fuck yourself.](https://media.giphy.com/media/5xtDarzp5at2qwSTYoo/giphy.gif) (This doesn't apply to MCRA tickets- those are a scam.)

[2017-01-28 05:06:05] We don't have one of the biggest harbors in the world so we can lose money. They cost money to maintain but they aren't intended to operate at a loss. If you look at a map of the city, it's barely four blocks long all the way down to the port because the port is big money. Long Beach, too.

As for the valley, everything is already in place. They don't necessarily get as much attention with street services as somewhere like Sawtelle, but they aren't ignored like stretches of South Central. If they formed their own city they would have to form new local governments and boards to perform a job that someone else already has. Another mayor, another city hall (probably in Van Nuys), a new police force or more likely a contract with LAPD to remain at the valley area stations with an ad hoc oversight board, same thing with Fire and Rec and Parks. These are already staffed and funded.

And really, what benefit would the valley get? I agree certain services need to be offered faster or with easier access, but that applies to a lot of the city. For the most part the valley is doing fine.

[2017-02-26 18:19:29] [Here's proof for this story.](https://www.cheapassgamer.com/topic/128532-the-old-gamerushblockbuster-thread/page-32). My CAG username is "kunai." You can just follow from that page and also see other crazy epic scores I've made. (Like the insane "Get any 5 games for $5 each" Blockbuster promo).

------

Back in the day (2007/2008) I found a major flaw in the POS at Blockbuster

Their system would update overnight, but only certain parts, and these parts were on different days of the week. Their new item prices would update on Thursday, their used prices would update on Friday- BUT their trade-in values would update after closing on Sunday.

This meant if a game dropped in MSRP, it's new version would first lower on Thursday morning ($49.99 to $19.99) and be cheaper than the used version. The next day, on Friday morning, its used version would be lowered ($47.99 to $17.99).

The trade-in value would still be the same- usually $30-$35, even though you could pull the game off the rack, buy it for $20, then trade in back without leaving the line.

I did this a few times and felt bad so I emailed corporate to let them know about the loophole. They told me they didn't take in information/suggestions from outside parties, essentially because they had that set up as part of their "business strategy."

I then proceeded to assist them in their endeavors by buying 25+ copies of Beowulf from Best Buy for $9.99 ($19.99-$10 coupon) and trading them in for ~$800 in store credit.

Then I repurchased all 25 copies with the store credit for ~$500.

Then I traded them in again.

Then I bought them again.

I did this a few times over the weekend and ended up with $1200 in store credit from $250 cash. 

Then I found a few games GameStop gave good money for and traded them in over there for store credit. I made some preorders for Street Fighter IV and eventually canceled them and requested cash back for the deposit. Then I got shitfaced at Almost Acoustic Christmas to celebrate.

I eventually got a letter from Blockbuster banning me from trading, but it had the wrong date (post dated for the next year) and I kept trading.

I don't feel bad about it.

[2017-03-31 04:50:01] I hate my hairline. Awhile ago I mentioned how I look like an MMA fighter with my head shaved, and the girl I'm into is into MMA. I'm hoping it's a win-win.

[2017-03-31 11:50:44] It fucking sucks.

I'm a romantic. I will fall for a girl hard and be dedicated to just her. That's the way all of my relationships have been. My longest was 9-years, and through all the emotional abuse bullshit I kept trying to make it work. Now I know those aren't worth it.

I don't do one-night stands, and I don't want to get to know someone I'm not instantly attracted to. Everyone keeps saying "just enjoy being single" and I don't want to. I don't want to date around. 

I know what I want, and when I find it my mind goes to one place: "I don’t wanna be friends. I can hate you or love you for the rest of my life. Those are the choices as I see it."

Yo quiero mi diosa. I want someone to worship.

[2017-04-02 17:08:58] A lot.

I did it in 2007. I think we had Take XIX. We went on a retreat in the mountains. Highly recommended.

[2017-04-03 03:19:40] I held off watching it because I figured it was just another over-the-top action anime.

Nobody told me it was a hilarious satire on over-the-top action anime.

I love it.

[2017-04-03 04:04:24] I actually bring my own food in!

Bacon wrapped Kirkland Signature hotdogs on sesame buns with grilled onions, relish, jalapenos, ketchup, and mustard, plus single serve bags of peanuts, crackerjack, and sunflower seeds. Sometimes I'll bring in churros or sweet potato fries.

If I'm pressed for time I just stop by Tommy's on Rampart and grab a caliente burger and chili cheese fries.

Either way I park in Elysian, pregame it and walk over with a Dodger cup full of beer, finish it before I get to the gate, find my seat, and chill.

I also broke a fence last night according to my brother.

[2017-04-14 07:20:19] I'm not sure.

My client is her voice coach and she's been praising her talent for weeks. Our paths crossed very briefly, and this Monday I first heard her album and loved her voice. Got invited to the album drop at The Peppermint Club on Wednesday night and was super impressed.

I got her number and I'm hoping to collaborate with her on lyrics. I'll ask her about future shows.

[2017-04-17 10:42:57] 
&gt;I'll be structuring my daily schedule around taking dance classes and surfing lessons.

Where?

&gt;I was thinking of Korea Town or Venice Beach but I really have no idea what would be a good location. 

That's two different ends of two different spectrums.


&gt;* How to get around? I will not be able to rent a car while i'm there, so i'm thinking i'll have to rely on Uber and Lyft to get around, but that will be pricy. How is public transit? Should I look into getting a bike maybe?

Depends on where you stay.

&gt;* Possible Part-Time Job? Since i'll be there for a whole month, I want to work part-time if I can, but I have no idea if that's possible since i'll need a work visa? 

No idea, that's research you should do.

&gt;Does anyone know if it's possible or where to look for under the table part-time gigs?

Craigslist. Or Backpage if you're desperate.

&gt;* Must do's? What are your recommendations for activities / places to go that are a must for someone's first time in LA?

Disneyland.

[2017-04-18 08:12:18] Copied and pasted from last time:

I can do anything I want.

My work days involve driving through West Hollywood, Beverly Hills, and Santa Monica because it's faster than the freeways and it takes at least 45 minutes to get home but I know how to get around traffic.

I can skateboard through downtown, the Arts District, and Little Tokyo, and an Uber back home is $3. My coffee costs more. The other day I got all the way to the [Always Sunny](https://www.instagram.com/p/BPvbIGMA8EzdHW-eZjWBtuuT3KQBdDOiQ1tflI0/) building just because.

I can buy one macaroon for $2.50 from Bottega Louie or pupusas on the street for $1 each. I can wait in line at Shake Shack or eat like a proper gentleman at In-N-Out. Denny's is garbage, Norms is life. Have you even heard of Dino's? KBBQ, SGV Chinese food, sushi, elote, asada, Papa Christo's, danger dogs, Mendocino, Lucy's, Langer's, Lemonade, Lawry's, Urth, Stinking Rose, Caveman Kitchen, Happy Taco, King Taco, El Flaming Taco, paleteros, "Tamales! Tamales!"

Bars? *Everywhere.* Upscale, hipster, lounge, club, dive, trap, sports, sake, beer, whiskey, single, dance, group, arcade...

Groceries aren't taxed. Costco, Trader Joe's, Smart and Final, Numero Uno, Vallarta, Ralphs, Vons, Northgate- you probably live near one of those, which is super convenient. You can at least host people if you can't afford to go out.

I freeze to death at 50° but once it's February and hits 75° I run shirtless across Redondo, Hermosa and Manhattan Beach. I'll get fresh Poké for lunch then hit up the craft breweries in South Bay.

Nature? Griffith Park, Runyon Canyon, Angeles Forest, Kenneth Hahn, Lake Balboa, Silverlake, Elysian, Echo, top of Reseda, even fucking Barnsdall is serene.

Snow? Big Bear. Snow Valley. Mammoth.

Culture? Getty, Getty Villa, LACMA, Gene Autry, Petersen, MOCA, Broad, Jurassitech, Expo Park, the rest of Museum Row, Watts Towers, alleys full of street art across the whole city...

Colleges? UCLA, USC, CSUN (Matadors!), CSULA, CSUDH, LMU, MSM, Pierce, Valley, Santa Monica, LACC, Pasadena, Glendale...

Amusement? Disneyland, Knotts, Universal, Six Flags, Sherman Oaks Castle Park, The Grove, the Zoo, the observatory, Hollywood and Highland, LA Live...

Live stage? UCB, ZJU, The Improv, Flappers, VPAC, Magic Castle, Jimmy Kimmel, The  Price Is Right, nearly every sitcom on TV...

Style? Rodeo Drive, Slauson Swap Meet, The Farmers Market, Arts District, MacArthur Park, Melrose, Fairfax, Fashion District, Crenshaw, Abott Kinney, the Galleria, PDC...

Conventions? E3, AX, Stan Lee's Comic Con, car shows, fitness expos, career summits, Adult Con, Reptile Expo, Tattoo Expo, League of Legends world championships...

Sports? Dodgers are life. Fuck you if you say anything against them. Lakers, Kings, Clippers, Galaxy, that new football club. Trojans, Bruins. Rams are a thing, kind of, but not really. Chargers are a joke. The Angels aren't Los Angeles.

Want to blackout for just a weekend? Vegas is a 5 hour drive away. So iS TJ. Jumbo's is down the street though.

Need to get away? SF, Portland, and Seattle are $50 roundtrip from LAX if you play it right. 

Broke? $1.75 can get you nearly anywhere on Metro. Go run, or bike. Cic La Via is free. Someone will try to steal your bike if you leave it outside.

There's so much goddamn music it's impossible to do everything. Coachella, FYF, Hard, Roxy, Viper Room, Troubadour, Spaceland, Echo... I'm not even close to listing even 5% of venues. Go wander across York between Fig and Eagle Rock. One of the best live shows I've been to was Kitten at a house party.

It's also hard to make plans with friends because everyone is always doing *something* and nobody lives near you. I still have a copy of One Night Ultimate Werewolf sealed from over a year ago because nobody has been able to come over to play it.

If you don't know how to drive I will yell at you. I will literally yell at you if you stop between 4 and 7pm on Olympic because you deserve it. If you signal I will let you do anything, even if it's stupid, just because you've warned me. DON'T BLOCK THE INTERSECTION YOU UNCALCULATED FUCK.

"I got a parking ticket." Did you read the signs?

"Why are there helicopters at-" **BECAUSE THIS IS LOS ANGELES.**

"Hollywood is so fake." So stop going there.

"Where should I live?" As close to work as possible.

"I got a red light ticket. Do I have to pay it?" [Maybe, maybe not. Maybe fuck yourself.](https://media.giphy.com/media/5xtDarzp5at2qwSTYoo/giphy.gif) (This doesn't apply to MCRA tickets- those are a scam.)

[2017-04-19 06:31:22] Even my Latino friends pronounce it "Lōs Fee-lizz." You're clearly a transplant if you say "Loss Fell-eez."

It's not like we pronounce Los Angeles in the correct Spanish way. We say "Loss Ann-juh-liss."

Don't come in correcting people who have lived in the area for decades. Try going to New York and trying to tell them it's supposed to be "Green-which Village." Or that it's the "Will-uh-met" River in Portland.

[2017-04-19 07:11:27] I've always had a huge forehead that bothered the fuck out of me, and I noticed my crown was thinning. So I said fuck it and shaved it off.

[2017-04-20 11:53:04] You can ignore MRCA stop-sign tickets. They're bullshit.

The organization has the same authority as a neighborhood watch and the money is extortion.

I got one for "running a stop sign" in 2008. They send out a threatening letter that looks real, but they don't have authority to issue tickets. Mine was signed by a "witness" in Arizona who viewed a video of me running a stop sign (which was bullshit to begin with). If you don't pay, they increase the "amount owed." They then try to send it to a collections agency, but since it's not a real debt they can't actually do anything.

Google what you can about them- your ticket is most likely illegitimate.

[2017-04-22 05:01:37] I park near ARTC at 4:30am then Uber in.

[2017-04-23 03:51:02] April 29th, 1992

There was a riot on the streets, tell me where were you?

You were sitting home watching your tv

While I was participating in some anarchy

First spot we hit it was my liquor store

I finally got all that alcohol I can't afford

With red lights flashing time to retire

And then we turned that liquor store into a structure fire

Next stop we hit it was the music shop

It only took one brick to make that window drop

Finally we got our own PA

Where do you think I got this guitar that you're hearing today?

When we returned to the pad to unload everything

It dawned on me that I need new home furnishings

So once again we filled the van until it was full

Since that day my living room's been more comfortable

Cause everybody in the hood has had it up to here

It's getting harder and harder and harder each and every year

Some kids went in a store with their mother

I saw her when she came out she was getting some pampers

They said it was for the black man

They said it was for the mexican, and not for the white man

But if you look at the streets it wasn't about Rodney King

It's bout this fucked up situation and these fucked up police

It's about coming up and staying on top

And screaming 187 on a motherfuckin' cop

It's not written on the paper it's on the wall

National guard??! smoke from all around

[2017-04-29 05:00:07] I came here sometime in 1991 with one focus. I quickly joined the LAPD and used extreme judgment in attaining my goals, though there were setbacks. Some day I hope to accomplish my mission: to terminate John Connor and stop the human resistance.
